# Aldr Ecosystem Project Brief

## ðŸš¨ **IMPORTANT NOTES:**
**IRISH DIASPORA MARKET STRATEGY** - This is background market research and founder-market fit analysis only. Do NOT include Irish references or culturally specific content in the actual application UI, copy, or marketing materials. This remains a private strategic consideration for go-to-market planning.

## Project Overview
The Aldr Ecosystem is a comprehensive document storage and health management platform that allows users to organize and manage important documents across three main categories: Health, Legal, and Identity. The project evolved from the original SOMA Companion application into a full-featured document vault system.

## Project Structure
The repository contains multiple integrated projects:

### Core Aldr Projects
1. **Aldr Vaults MVP** - `/aldr-vaults-mvp/` - Main homepage and navigation hub
2. **Aldr Health Companion** - `/aldr-health-companion/` - Personal health record management (formerly SOMA Companion)
3. **SOMA Colleague (Provider Platform)** - `/SOMA Colleague (Provider Platform)/` - Healthcare provider interface (maintained separately)

### Demo Projects
4. **Aldr Health Individual Full Demo** - `/aldr-health-individual-full-demo/` - Complete demo version
5. **Aldr Health Provider Full Demo** - `/aldr-health-provider-full-demo/` - Provider demo version

## Current Priority
The primary focus is on the **Aldr Health Companion** as the main demo application. The MVP has been simplified to launch directly into Aldr Health Companion, with Aldr ID accessible via the header navigation. The overall dashboard (HomePage) and Aldr Legal are kept in place for the full platform experience, but the **demo showcases Aldr Health Companion & Aldr ID** as the core features.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with React Router
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Icons**: Font Awesome
- **Build**: Create React App

## Branding
- **Primary Color**: Teal (#20B2AA)
- **Secondary Color**: Purple (#8A2BE2)
- **Gradient**: Linear gradient from Teal to Purple (45 degrees)
- **Fonts**: Segoe UI, Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif

## Design Resources
Design specifications have been exported to:
- `/mnt/c/Users/james/Desktop/aldr-design-exports/`

npm install
npm start
```
Access at: http://localhost:3000 (opens directly to Aldr Health)

### Aldr Health Companion
```powershell
cd Documents\soma-companion\aldr-health-companion
npm install

## Language Toggle Implementation Assessment

### Difficulty: **Moderate** (2-3 days for proper implementation)

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **React i18n Integration** - Use react-i18next library
2. **Translation Files** - JSON files for each language (en.json, fr.json, es.json, etc.)
3. **Context Provider** - Global language state management
4. **Header Integration** - Language toggle dropdown in UniformHeader component
5. **Text Extraction** - Replace hardcoded strings with translation keys

**Key Areas Requiring Translation:**
- Header navigation (Aldr ID, Add New Record, Contact, Log Out)
- Dashboard content (Health Stats, Recent Records, Appointments)
- Form labels and buttons
- Record details and medical terminology
- Error messages and notifications

**Recommended Languages:**
- **English** (default)
- **French** (Canadian French for international appeal)
- **Spanish** (large global market)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Install react-i18next dependency
- Create translation JSON files
- Wrap App with I18nextProvider
- Update all components with useTranslation hook
- Add language detection and persistence (localStorage)

**Estimated Effort:** 16-24 hours of development time for full implementation

### âœ… **Quick Implementation Added (June 12, 2025)**
Added "Coming Soon" language toggle button to UniformHeader:
- Globe icon with "EN" label
- Click shows tooltip: "Multi-language support coming soon!"
- Positioned between Add New Record and Contact buttons
- Auto-dismisses after 2 seconds
- Ready for future i18n integration

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: GitHub Repository Setup & Vercel Deployment
1. **Update GitHub repository** with latest Aldr Vaults MVP code
   - Ensure all recent RecordDetails.js improvements are committed
   - Update sample-records.js with expanded cross-disciplinary insights

   - Configure build settings for React application
   - Set up custom domain if needed
   - Ensure proper routing for SPA (Single Page Application)
   - Test deployment with current feature set

### Future Development Roadmap

4. Implement real backend connections for all vaults
5. Add document upload/storage functionality
6. Implement user authentication and security
7. Create mobile-responsive refinements
8. Add data export/import capabilities
9. Expand AI insights system with real medical knowledge base
10. Add care plan integration (connect with SOMA Colleague platform)
