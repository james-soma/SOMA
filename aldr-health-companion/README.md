# SOMA Health Companion

**A personal health vault designed to help individuals manage their health information across different systems, borders, and life stages.**

SOMA Health Companion is a personal health vault designed to help individuals manage their health information across different systems, borders, and life stages. It provides a straightforward, structured interface for managing records, generating user-directed insights, and communicating effectively with providers on the user's terms.

## Core Features

### User Experience Vision

- Clean, minimalist design with a clear information dashboard & hierarchy
- Simple sharing tools that let users choose exactly what to share—and for how long
- Language toggle to support communication across systems, borders, and care settings
- 'Smart-ingestion' pipeline for easy upload—manual entry or email submission with automatic matching, tagging, and record classification

### Data Mode vs. Opinion Mode

At the heart of SOMA Health Companion is a simple but powerful concept: users decide how their health information is presented and interpreted. The Opinion Mode feature inspired the name "Companion"—like a trusted guide who offers perspective but never replaces professional care.

**Data Mode:**

- Raw health record data with no interpretation
- Factual information only (default view)
- Ideal for clinical sharing
- No AI-generated content

**Opinion Mode:**

- AI-generated insights based on sources the user selects and locks in
- Multiple medical perspectives (e.g., GP, physio, holistic)
- Full source transparency
- Activated only by user choice

### Specialized Health Tracking

- Modules for chronic conditions, mental health, and rehab
- Recovery tracking and progress monitoring
- Preventive screening prompts
- Support for complementary and alternative therapies

### Provider Sharing Controls

- Time-limited, permissioned data sharing
- Access logs for complete visibility
- Instantly revocable sharing
