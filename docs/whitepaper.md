## Abstract

SOMA provides individuals with complete ownership of their health records, identity documents, and essential information through secure, private vaults built on the revolutionary Autonomi network. This whitepaper outlines the technical architecture, security model, and implementation roadmap for the SOMA platform.

## 1. Introduction

In an increasingly mobile world, individuals face significant challenges in maintaining consistent access to their health records and identity information when crossing borders, changing healthcare providers, or rebuilding after displacement. SOMA addresses these challenges through a decentralized architecture that prioritizes individual data ownership while maintaining high security standards.

The SOMA platform represents a paradigm shift in how personal data is stored, shared, and verified. By leveraging blockchain technology and zero-knowledge proofs, SOMA creates a system where individuals have complete sovereignty over their information while enabling controlled sharing with healthcare providers, government agencies, and other authorized parties.

### 1.1 The Problem of Fragmented Health Records

Healthcare systems worldwide operate as isolated silos, making it difficult for individuals to maintain a comprehensive health history when they:

- Travel internationally for business or leisure
- Relocate between countries for work or immigration
- Seek refugee status due to conflict or natural disasters
- Access healthcare across different providers or systems
- Need emergency care away from their primary healthcare provider

This fragmentation leads to dangerous information gaps, duplicated tests, medication errors, and difficulty accessing specialized care. For vulnerable populations like refugees and migrants, these challenges can become life-threatening.

### 1.2 The Limitations of Existing Solutions

Current approaches to healthcare information management suffer from critical limitations:

- **Centralized Control**: Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems are owned and controlled by institutions, not individuals
- **Jurisdictional Boundaries**: Health information rarely crosses borders effectively
- **Interoperability Challenges**: Different standards and formats prevent seamless information exchange
- **Privacy Concerns**: Sharing sensitive data often requires compromising privacy
- **Verification Difficulties**: Proving the authenticity of medical records across systems is problematic
- **Digital Divides**: Many solutions exclude those with limited technology access

### 1.3 The SOMA Vision

SOMA offers a revolutionary approach that addresses these limitations by providing:

- **Individual Data Ownership**: Personal vaults with complete user control
- **Global Accessibility**: Borderless access to personal health information
- **Secure Verification**: Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification
- **Interoperability**: Standards-agnostic data model with automated translation
- **Inclusive Design**: Functionality that works across digital divides
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Concurrent updates across all authorized devices
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Support for all personal records, not just health

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 SOMA Companion

The patient-facing application that provides a seamless interface for managing, viewing, and sharing health records.

SOMA Companion serves as the personal interface to an individual's health vault. It empowers users to:

- **Import Records**: Scan, upload, or directly connect to existing health systems
- **Organize Information**: Categorize and sort health information by type, date, or provider
- **Control Access**: Grant and revoke access to specific records or categories
- **Verify Data**: Prove the authenticity of records without exposing their contents
- **Share Selectively**: Choose exactly what information to share with each provider
- **Maintain Privacy**: Keep sensitive information secure with end-to-end encryption
- **Access Offline**: Critical information remains available even without internet connectivity
- **Travel Confidently**: Access healthcare abroad with complete medical history

The application features a unique "Data/Opinion" toggle that separates verifiable clinical records from AI-generated insights, ensuring users and providers can distinguish between factual data and interpretive information.

### 2.2 SOMA Colleague 

The provider-facing application that allows healthcare professionals to access shared records and contribute to a patient's health record in a standardized format.

SOMA Colleague is designed for healthcare providers and offers:

- **Streamlined Access**: View patient-shared records in a clinically-optimized interface
- **Professional Documentation**: Create and sign clinical notes and assessments
- **Standards Compliance**: Ensure all contributions meet relevant regulatory standards
- **Cross-Border Interpretation**: Automatically translate between healthcare coding systems
- **Consent Management**: Clear visibility of patient-granted permissions
- **Clinical Workflow Integration**: Compatibility with existing healthcare IT systems
- **Medical Terminology Support**: Automatic mapping between different regional terminologies
- **Audit Capability**: Complete transparency of all access and modifications

The application is designed to integrate with existing healthcare information systems while respecting the patient's ultimate ownership of their data. Providers can contribute to the patient's record, but ultimate control over access and sharing remains with the individual.

### 2.3 Autonomi Network

The underlying infrastructure that enables secure, decentralized storage and verification of health records while maintaining individual ownership.
