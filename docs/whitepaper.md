# SOMA: Your Data, Your Control
Somavault.io
Executive Summary
SOMA  is a secure, decentralized platform that aims to give individuals complete control over their critical personal information, starting with Health. 
Currently in development, our vision is to build on the revolutionary Autonomi network (autonomi.com), creating a comprehensive ecosystem where personal data would be private by design and wholly owned by the individual:
SOMA Health Companion - Personal health management for individuals navigating complex healthcare systems
SOMA Health Colleague - Provider platform for seamless, patient-controlled health information sharing
SOMA Bridge - Identity & health record continuity solution for displaced populations
At launch, SOMA will focus on two key markets:
Global Citizens: For those building lives in new places, while their health records get left behind. SOMA helps people navigate fragmented systems, disconnected histories, and the frustration of starting over every time they need care.
Displaced Populations - Working with humanitarian organizations to provide continuity of care and identity verification for those who have lost access to their medical records
Moving forward in life shouldn't mean losing your past.
Key innovations in our concept include:
Three-tier storage system ensuring security, accessibility, and offline resilience
SOMA ID foundation provides a secure identity with granular access controls
Clear separation between factual data and user-controlled AI insights
Multi-language support and translations for global accessibility
Partnerships with humanitarian organizations to serve displaced populations
Our Vision for the Future
SOMA is more than a platform—it is a new model for how individuals carry, protect, and activate their most important information. Whether navigating complex health systems or rebuilding after displacement, SOMA aims to restore agency, access, and continuity.
This vision includes:
A world where identity, health records, and qualifications travel with individuals across borders, systems, and stages of life
AI support that is user-controlled, clearly sourced, and shaped by diverse medical perspectives
True data sovereignty that rebalances power—from systems back to individuals
Health insights grounded in both cutting-edge research and historical wisdom
Tools that serve the most vulnerable as thoughtfully as they do the most privileged
By building on the Autonomi network, SOMA lays the foundation for a future in which trust, resilience, and individual autonomy are not features but defaults.
As the platform evolves, there is an opportunity to expand into a broader suite of personal vaults—supporting not just health and identity, but memories, finances, and more.

The Autonomi Opportunity
The launch of Autonomi represents a once-in-a-generation shift in digital architecture—the emergence of a truly decentralized network that enables user-owned data vaults with unprecedented security and privacy. 
Autonomi's Impossible Futures platform provides an accelerated market entry pathway, allowing builders to gain visibility while the Autonomi ecosystem develops. 
Note: At the time of writing (April 22) SOMA has qualified for phase two of Possible Futures. We plan to build a team and secure funding to progress the SOMA Health concept regardless of the outcome.
The SOMA Suite
SOMA's vision is to create a suite of personal vaults for what matters most to the individual—health, identity, memories, and beyond. Built on the Autonomi network, each vault is private by design and wholly owned by the user.
We begin with three integrated applications:
SOMA Health Companion – Personal health management for individuals navigating complex healthcare systems
SOMA Health Colleague – Provider platform for seamless, patient-controlled health information sharing
SOMA Bridge – Identity and health record continuity for displaced populations
These three pillars lay the foundation for a broader ecosystem of user-controlled tools.
SOMA Health
SOMA Health envisions a world where individuals have complete control over their health information—securely stored, transparently interpreted, and easily shared on their terms. The platform combines personal agency, advanced AI insights, and smooth, provider-compatible collaboration.
It includes two independent but connected applications:
SOMA Health Companion – A personal health vault that helps individuals manage their medical history, track treatments, understand their health through user-directed AI insights, and communicate clearly across languages and systems.


SOMA Health Colleague – A provider-facing platform that enables clinicians to access patient-shared records, contribute notes, and collaborate—all within a permissioned, patient-controlled environment.
Together, they offer a structured yet flexible approach to modern health management.
Our concept aims to address the universal problem of fragmented medical records through:
A unified, secure, and user-controlled health vault that travels with individuals 
A dual-focused ecosystem combining patient experience (SOMA Companion) with provider interface (SOMA Colleague)
A foundation built on trust, transparency, and user control
Clear separation between factual medical data and user-controlled AI-powered insights through our Data Mode and Opinion Mode toggle
Underpinned by SOMA ID, our foundational identity layer. Note: We may also integrate with existing identity solutions being developed on Autonomi
This approach establishes a new future in health information management, where individuals always know the source and nature of the health information they are viewing.
SOMA Health Companion
SOMA Health Companion is a personal health vault designed to help individuals manage their health information across different systems, borders, and life stages. It provides a straightforward, structured interface for managing records, generating user-directed insights, and communicating effectively with providers on the user's terms.

User Experience Vision
Clean, minimalist design with a clear information dashboard & hierarchy
Simple sharing tools that let users choose exactly what to share—and for how long
Language toggle to support communication across systems, borders, and care settings
'Smart-ingestion' pipeline for easy upload—manual entry or email submission with automatic matching, tagging, and record classification
Data Mode vs. Opinion Mode
At the heart of SOMA Health Companion is a simple but powerful concept: users decide how their health information is presented and interpreted. The Opinion Mode feature inspired the name "Companion"—like a trusted guide who offers perspective but never replaces professional care.
Data Mode:
Raw health record data with no interpretation
Factual information only (default view)
Ideal for clinical sharing
No AI-generated content
Opinion Mode:
AI-generated insights based on sources the user selects and locks in
Multiple medical perspectives (e.g., GP, physio, holistic)
Full source transparency
Activated only by user choice


Specialized Health Tracking
Modules for chronic conditions, mental health, and rehab
Recovery tracking and progress monitoring
Preventive screening prompts
Support for complementary and alternative therapies


Provider Sharing Controls
Time-limited, permissioned data sharing
Access logs for complete visibility
Instantly revocable sharing

SOMA Health Colleague
SOMA Colleague offers healthcare professionals secure, patient-controlled access to health information. While it's designed to function independently or alongside SOMA Health Companion, its value grows over time: each new provider who joins the platform strengthens the network and improves the patient experience across the system.

Clinical Documentation Tools
SOMA Colleague provides healthcare professionals with powerful tools to create, manage, and share clinical documentation while maintaining the patient's ultimate control over their health information.
At the heart of SOMA Colleague's clinical documentation capabilities are Synchronized Care Plans - a revolutionary approach to care coordination designed for globally mobile individuals and those navigating fragmented healthcare systems.
Key Features:
Real-time Bidirectional Synchronization: Care plans created in SOMA Colleague instantly appear in the patient's SOMA Companion app, while patient-logged data flows back to providers in real-time
Multiple Provider Collaboration: Enable seamless coordination between specialists across different healthcare systems and geographic boundaries
Global Adaptability: Automatically adjust medication schedules, monitoring requirements, and recommendations based on the patient's current time zone and location
Data/Opinion Mode Integration: Maintains SOMA's core philosophy by clearly separating provider instructions (Data Mode) from AI-assisted implementation guidance (Opinion Mode)


Implementation Example: Managing Chronic Conditions Across Borders
For patients with conditions requiring consistent monitoring and management, Synchronized Care Plans ensure continuity regardless of location changes:
The primary provider creates a structured care plan with monitoring schedules, medication regimens, and treatment goals
Additional specialists can contribute to specific aspects of the care plan from their respective locations
The patient receives a unified plan in their SOMA Companion app with clear tasks, reminders, and monitoring prompts
As the patient logs data or completes tasks, their entire care team receives real-time updates
When traveling to different time zones or regions, the plan automatically adjusts without disrupting the overall care approach


Visit Documentation
Beyond care plans, SOMA Colleague allows providers to create comprehensive visit documentation that becomes part of the patient's secure health record:
Structured clinical notes with standardized templates
Treatment recommendations and care instructions
Medication changes with detailed rationales
Follow-up scheduling and coordination
Educational resources specific to the patient's condition
Document Exchange
Secure, permission-based document exchange enables providers to:
Share diagnostic results with contextual interpretation
Provide medical necessity documentation
Exchange referral information between specialists
Deliver patient education materials
Request additional information from previous providers (with patient permission)
All clinical documentation in SOMA Colleague adheres to healthcare data standards while maintaining the patient's ultimate ownership and control through SOMA's decentralized architecture.

Founder's Story and Motivation
Co-creators James Stafford and Catherine Conaghan conceived SOMA Health from their personal experiences with fragmented healthcare:
James's year-long back pain journey led to conflicting specialist advice and misdiagnosis until a Sakra healer identified the actual condition
Their daughter's eye condition received contradictory treatment recommendations from specialists, and transferring records between providers proved unnecessarily complex.
Despite growing up with centralized healthcare, both founders' adult lives across multiple countries created scattered medical records across different systems, languages, and standards. This highlights how international lifestyles lead to medical information being dispersed across patient portals, email attachments, and various apps—everything saved somewhere, yet nothing easily accessible when needed.



SOMA BRIDGE 
SOMA Bridge is designed for individuals who have been uprooted by conflict, disaster, or the search for a new life, when proving your identity, qualifications, and health history becomes essential. It provides a portable, private vault that travels with the individual across borders and systems, supporting continuity, access, and stability.

Narrative Concept: Stories in Transition
As part of our broader vision for SOMA Bridge, we are exploring a storytelling initiative to follow the real-world journeys of individuals using the platform to rebuild their lives. These narrative threads—shared as blog updates, short videos, or first-person reflections—would illustrate how displaced professionals use SOMA to carry their identity, health history, and qualifications into new systems.
Example storylines under consideration:
A Ukrainian pharmacist navigating integration into the Portuguese healthcare system
A Syrian engineer assembling a credential portfolio for employment in the EU
A Congolese midwife using SOMA to access past training and treatment records in a new host country
These stories, shared on somavault.io (built on the Autonomi network), are a way to humanize decentralized tech, build empathy, and demonstrate the practical impact of SOMA Bridge in action.
Platform Architecture
SOMA ID: Identity Foundation
SOMA ID is envisioned as a foundational identity layer, creating a central hub for digital identity within the health ecosystem. It would securely store:
Essential identification (name, birthdate, contact information, scan of physical ID such as passport/government ID)
Emergency contacts and care preferences 
Consent directives and sharing permissions
Authentication credentials and access controls
Three-Tier Storage System
SOMA plans to offer users three synchronized storage options for their health information:
Autonomi Network Storage: Primary storage on the decentralized Autonomi network providing maximum security
Personal Vault Server: An optional physical device that would serve as a tangible backup, providing offline access to health records even during internet outages or system failures
Organized Paper Backups: Integrated printing system with standardized formats for critical health documents, ensuring access regardless of technological availability
Security and Privacy Framework
While SOMA Health remains in the concept phase, the platform is being designed with best-in-class privacy and security principles at its core—drawing on established protections such as end-to-end encryption, zero-knowledge architecture, and multi-factor authentication, alongside user-controlled access, decentralized storage, and transparent data practices. We will align our implementation with Autonomi platform protocols to ensure seamless integration and maximum security.

Business Model | SOMA Health
"If you have to pay somebody to access your information, it's no longer your information." — Sarah Buxton (Bux), CEO of Autonomi
At SOMA, we believe your data should always be yours—permanently accessible, without gatekeepers, rent, or restrictions.
This principle drives the business model behind SOMA Health, designed to be sustainable without ever compromising user ownership. Revenue is never tied to access or control. Instead, monetization comes from value-added services, enhanced features, and ethical, user-centric partnerships.
It's important to note this model applies specifically to SOMA Health—our product for individuals and families navigating fragmented healthcare systems. By contrast, SOMA Bridge forms part of SOMA's broader humanitarian mission. Bridge deployments will be funded through partnerships with aid agencies, NGOs, and global institutions committed to restoring access, identity, and continuity for displaced populations.
SOMA Health and SOMA Bridge share infrastructure, but serve very different realities, and are supported by distinct funding strategies.
SOMA Health Companion | Business Model
SOMA Health Companion is built on the principle that individuals should retain full, unrestricted access to their personal health information. The model is simple: a one-time purchase provides lasting access, with optional features available for those who want deeper insight, greater convenience, or physical tools.
One-Time Vault Purchase (€X Individual / €Y Family)
Permanent SOMA Vault with a fixed storage limit (e.g. 1 GB individual / 5 GB family)
Includes offline sync, print-ready formatting, and a base storage cap
7-day free trial (no credit card required)
Optional Features (Priced Separately)
Insight View – AI-powered guidance based on sources the user selects
 Recurring: €X/month or €X/year
Vault Expansion – Add more storage as your records grow
 Recurring: €X per GB/month
Print & Post – Receive printed summaries every 6 or 12 months
 Fixed: €X per delivery
Home Vault – Durable personal server for offline/local access
 Fixed: €X one-time purchase
Biometric Access Devices – Optional fingerprint or eye scanner
 Fixed: €X one-time purchase


This flexible structure supports full user ownership while offering scalable, high-value tools for those who need more. It reflects our belief that people should never pay to access their information, but may choose to enhance how they protect, understand, or share it.

SOMA Health Colleague | Business Model
Patients remain the data owners—providers are granted access, not control.
This foundational principle shapes every part of the SOMA Health Colleague platform. Providers can view, annotate, and request records—but never store, sell, or take ownership of patient data. Access is always consent-driven, time-limited, and can be revoked by the individual at any time.
SOMA Health Colleague is designed for healthcare professionals, clinics, and practices that need reliable access to structured health data, without the overhead of traditional EHR systems. The business model is simple, scalable, and aligned with provider workflows.

Creator Note
If you've made it this far, thank you. 
We have no illusions about the scale of what we are proposing, the difficulties we will face, or the vastness of the issues we aim to solve. 
In conversations of late, I have been using a no doubt overused but equally apt term - that we are looking to form a 'team of avengers' to help us with SOMA. 
I'm working back through 40+ years of my life to find the very best and nicest people I've met along the way to help join our mission. 
Our sense is we could build something great here, but we won't be able to do it alone. 
We are always open to new collaborators, so feel free to introduce yourself or somebody else to james@ruleyproductions.com 
Thanks, James & Catherine
