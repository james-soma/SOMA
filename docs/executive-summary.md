## Vision

SOMA gives individuals complete ownership of their personal information through secure, private vaults built on the revolutionary Autonomi network. Whether you're moving countries or rebuilding after displacement, SOMA ensures your health records, identity, and essential documentation remain accessible, portable, and always under your control.

## The Problem

In today's globalized world, personal health information is fragmented across healthcare systems, making it difficult for:

1. **International travelers** who need medical care abroad
2. **Expatriates and migrants** navigating multiple healthcare systems
3. **Refugees and displaced people** who have lost access to their records
4. **Healthcare providers** lacking critical information about new patients
5. **Individuals** who want control over who accesses their medical data

Traditional electronic health records are siloed, incompatible across borders, and controlled by institutions rather than individuals.

## The SOMA Solution

SOMA creates a paradigm shift in personal data ownership through:

### 1. SOMA Companion (Patient Application)
- Personal health vault with complete data ownership
- Multi-language interface for global accessibility
- Data/Opinion toggle for AI-enhanced insights
- Granular sharing controls for provider access
- Cross-border care coordination
