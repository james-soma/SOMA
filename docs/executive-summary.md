## Executive Summary

**SOMA** is a secure, decentralized platform designed to give individuals complete control over their most critical personal information, starting with health data. Built on the Autonomi network, SOMA’s mission is to ensure that personal data is private by design and wholly owned by the individual, not by institutions or third parties.

The SOMA ecosystem launches with three core applications:

- **SOMA Health Companion:** A personal health management tool that empowers individuals to manage, interpret, and share their health records on their own terms, with user-directed AI insights and multilingual support.
- **SOMA Health Colleague:** A provider-facing platform that enables clinicians to access and contribute to patient-shared records in a secure, patient-controlled environment.
- **SOMA Bridge:** A continuity solution for displaced populations, offering portable, private vaults for identity, health records, and qualifications—ensuring access and stability across borders and systems.

Key innovations include a three-tier storage system (decentralized, local, and paper backup), granular access controls via SOMA ID, clear separation between factual data and AI-generated insights, and robust offline and multilingual capabilities. SOMA is committed to serving both global citizens and displaced populations, partnering with humanitarian organizations to restore agency and continuity for those who need it most.

### Market Context

SOMA addresses several rapidly growing global markets:

- **Digital Health Records:** €27.95 billion ([coherentmarketinsights.com](https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/))
- **Healthcare Interoperability:** €4.59 billion ([mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/))
- **Identity Management:** €21.40 billion ([cognitivemarketresearch.com](https://www.cognitivemarketresearch.com/))
- **Cross-Border Healthcare:** €253.16 billion ([futuremarketinsights.com](https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/))

These figures highlight the scale and urgency of the challenges SOMA is designed to solve, from secure health data management and interoperability to global identity and cross-border care.

### Business Model

SOMA’s business model is rooted in true data ownership: users never pay to access their own information, and revenue comes from value-added services and ethical partnerships, not from restricting access. The platform offers a one-time purchase for permanent access to a personal health vault, with optional paid features such as AI-powered insights, expanded storage, printed summaries, and offline access devices. For healthcare providers, SOMA Health Colleague is offered via a simple, scalable subscription model, always ensuring that patients retain ultimate control over their data. Humanitarian deployments of SOMA Bridge are supported through partnerships with NGOs and global institutions.
