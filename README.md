Aldr aims to give you complete ownership of your personal information through secure, private vaults. As we develop we aim to develop both on web 2 traditional servers and work towards leveraging the revolutionary Autonomi network. Whether you're moving countries or rebuilding after displacement, Aldr's vision is to ensure your health records, identity, and essential documentation remain accessible, portable, and always under your control.
